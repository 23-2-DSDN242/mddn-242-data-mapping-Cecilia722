## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The theme I chose for this project is the scenery outside the window with a touch of fantasy.  I used masks to distinguish between the outdoor and indoor views, and then taught them to AI.  AI helped me generate more masks.  I added a blurry effect to the outdoor scenery using color blocks.  Then, I added x-axis and y-axis offsets on top of the pix.  I used offset data to adjust the floating glowing flowers, making them appear as if they were flying from the bright outdoors into the dark room.

For the interior part of the room, I referenced the textures of stiches and tattered fabric, arranging them loosely.  I hope this can tell a story to the audience about the gradual dissolution of a dark room under the magic of light.  Finally, I added the magic yellow sparks to dress the story even more by using random data.
